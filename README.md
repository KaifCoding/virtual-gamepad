## What is this?

Virtual Gamepad is a two-part open source project:

| | |
|---|---|
| 📱 **Android app** (Flutter) | On-screen dual analog sticks, D-pad, ABXY face buttons, shoulder buttons, and analog triggers. Auto-discovers your PC over WiFi. |
| 🖥️ **Windows host app** (C#) | Creates a genuine virtual **Xbox 360 controller** via [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus), so it works in *any* game or app that supports a normal controller — zero per-game setup. |

No subscriptions, no in-app purchases, no telemetry, no accounts. Just download and play.

## How it works

```
📱 Phone (Flutter app)  --UDP over WiFi-->  🖥️ PC (Windows host)  --ViGEmBus-->  🎮 Virtual Xbox 360 controller
```

The wire format is fully documented in [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md) if you're curious how it works under the hood.

## ✨ Features

- Dual analog sticks with full-range 16-bit precision
- Analog L2/R2 triggers (pressure slider, not just on/off)
- Full D-pad, ABXY, shoulder buttons, Start/Back
- Auto-discovery of PCs on your WiFi network — tap and play
- Manual IP entry fallback for tricky networks
- Multiple phones can connect at once, each gets its own virtual controller
- Keeps your phone screen locked to the right orientation while playing

## ⬇️ Download

**[Go to the Releases page →](https://github.com/kaifcoding/virtual-gamepad/releases/latest)**

Every release has both apps attached, ready to run — no build tools, no SDKs, no cloning anything:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `VirtualGamepad.apk` | The Android app. Copy to your phone and tap to install. |
| `VirtualGamepadHost-Setup.exe` | The Windows installer — Start Menu + Desktop icons, uninstaller included. |

### 📲 Install on your phone

Download `VirtualGamepad.apk` from the release page directly on your phone (or copy it over), then tap it to install. Android will ask permission to install from this source the first time — that's expected for any app outside the Play Store — allow it, then install.

### 🖥️ Set up your PC

1. Install **[ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest)** once — this is the driver that makes Windows see your phone as a real controller. Reboot if prompted.
2. Run `VirtualGamepadHost-Setup.exe` and follow the wizard (tick "Create a desktop icon" if you want one — it's on by default). No admin rights needed; it installs to your user profile.
3. **Windows SmartScreen will likely warn you** the first time — "Windows protected your PC." This is expected for any free/unsigned app (code-signing certificates cost money this project doesn't spend). Click **"More info" → "Run anyway."**
4. Launch **Virtual Gamepad Host** from the Start Menu or the desktop icon. The window shows your PC's IP address(es) — that's what you'll enter (or auto-discover) from the phone. Click "Show connection log" to see live connection activity.
5. Allow the app through **Windows Firewall** when prompted (check all network types — Domain, Private, *and* Public). If the prompt never appears, run [`windows-app/open-firewall-port.ps1`](windows-app/open-firewall-port.ps1) as Administrator to open the port manually.

### 🔗 Connect

1. Make sure your phone and PC are on the **same WiFi network**.
2. Open the app — it searches automatically and lists your PC by name.
3. Tap it to connect. If nothing shows up after a few seconds (see [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting)), type the IP shown in the PC's window instead.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

**The Windows app seems to not open at all**
Almost always **Windows SmartScreen** silently blocking it (see step 3 above) — look for a blue "Windows protected your PC" dialog, possibly behind other windows, and click "More info → Run anyway." If you truly see nothing, try running it from a terminal (open PowerShell in the install folder and run `.\VirtualGamepadHost.exe`) so any startup error has a chance to print.

**"Failed to create virtual controller" on the PC**
Install ViGEmBus, then restart the host app.

**Auto-discovery doesn't find the PC**
This is the most common issue and it's almost always the *network*, not the apps:
- Confirm phone and PC are on the exact same WiFi network (not phone hotspot + PC on ethernet from a different router, not a guest network for one and main for the other).
- Many routers — especially mesh systems (eero, Google Nest WiFi), guest networks, and public/hotel WiFi — enable **"AP isolation" / "client isolation,"** which blocks device-to-device traffic on purpose for security. This is a router setting, not something the apps can bypass. Check your router's admin settings, or connect both devices to a different network without isolation.
- Confirm Windows Firewall allowed `VirtualGamepadHost.exe` on **all** profiles — rerun [`open-firewall-port.ps1`](windows-app/open-firewall-port.ps1) as Administrator to be sure.
- Watch the PC app's log (click "Show connection log") while the phone searches — if you never see `Discovery request from ...` lines appear, the broadcast traffic isn't reaching the PC at all.
- **Manual IP entry always works** even when auto-discovery can't — type the IP shown in the PC app into the phone app.

**"No response" after entering an IP manually**
- Double check the IP — it changes if you reconnect to WiFi or restart the PC.
- Confirm the Virtual Gamepad Host window is actually running.
- Port `47998/UDP` needs to be reachable — see the firewall steps above.

**Input feels laggy**
This runs over UDP on WiFi, so it depends on your router and network congestion. A 5GHz network with fewer connected devices helps a lot.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] WiFi transport (UDP), full Xbox 360 button/axis mapping
- [x] Auto-discovery of PCs on the local network
- [x] Multiple phones connecting simultaneously
- [x] Windows host with a proper branded GUI window (not just a console)
- [x] Windows installer with Start Menu + Desktop shortcuts and uninstaller
- [x] Custom app icon (Android + Windows), custom app ID (`in.atomprod.vgamepad`)
- [x] Portrait-locked menus, landscape-locked gamepad screen
- [x] One-click downloads via GitHub Releases
- [ ] Bluetooth transport (fallback when there's no shared WiFi network)
- [ ] Customizable button layout / remapping in-app
- [ ] Rumble/vibration feedback from PC back to phone
- [ ] Windows tray icon (minimize-to-tray)
- [ ] iOS build (Flutter already supports it; needs a paid Apple developer account for signing)

## 🧑‍💻 Building from source (optional, for contributors)

You don't need any of this to just use the apps — see [Download](#-download) above. This is only for people who want to modify the code.

**Android app** — needs the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install):
```bash
cd android-app
flutter create --platforms=android --org in.atomprod .
cp manifest-overrides/AndroidManifest.xml android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
flutter pub get
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
flutter run              # with a device/emulator connected
```

**Windows app** — needs the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download):
```bash
cd windows-app
dotnet run
```

**Cutting a new release (maintainers):** push a version tag and the `Release` GitHub Actions workflow builds both apps and attaches them to a new GitHub Release automatically:
```bash
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```
